The purpose of this website is to showcase myself and my work to potential employers and recruiters. 

# UX

Ease of navigation to the about me, portfolio and contact me pages from every page on the website through the navigation bar within the header. 

About me page split into clear sections based on type of experience / personality information. 

Portfolio page also split clearly into sections based on the type / skill of work, with most recent / relevant first.  

GitHub and LinkedIn links in footer so its easy to contact me through these channels.
