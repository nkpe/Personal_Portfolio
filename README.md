# Personal Portfolio - Project One
<!-- explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users. -->


The purpose of this website is to showcase myself and my work to potential employers and recruiters. The users of this website will be looking at my skills and abilities for potential employment. I have included an about page as an overview of myself and my achievements, along with a portfolio page so users can see examples of my work. A contact page allows any users of the website to get in touch with me.

# UX

 The use of the navigation bar within the header allows for easy navigation to the about me, portfolio and contact me pages from every page on the website. The addition of on-hover font bolding informs the user that these are links and which link they are hovering over.

The about me page split into clearly defined sections, through the use of colour blocks and headers, making it easy for the user to follow as well as find a particular section. Section are split based on type of experience / personality information. 

The portfolio page is also split clearly into sections through the use of colour based on the type / skill of work, with most recent / relevant first.  

GitHub and LinkedIn links are included in footer so its easy to contact me from any page on the website using these channels. I have used the logo for each so they are easily recognised, while keeping the footer simple.

# Testing
While building the website I regularly used Google Chrome, FireFox, Safari and Edge browsers to render my code, checking for any broken code and incompatibility. One example I found that Firefox and Safari rendered the select tag in HTML with a grey background, making, giving the form fields inconsistent styling. I fixed this by adding a class of form-field-background to each form field with a specified colour. 

I used the Dev Tools built into Chrome to test responsiveness of the website. When conducting these tests I found the responsiveness of the home page photo and the form fields needed to be handled with media queries.
